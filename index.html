            Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as
            small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big
            as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear).
            They're found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and
            Asia.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have non-retractable claws, short tails, and excellent sense of
            smell. They're typically solitary, except for mothers with cubs.
            There are eight species: Asiatic black bears (also called moon
            bears), brown bears (which include grizzly bears), giant pandas,
            North American black bears, polar bears, sloth bears, spectacled
            bears (also called Andean bears), and sun bears.
          </p>
          <p>
            On average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in
            captivity. Six species, including the polar bear and the giant
            panda, are included on the IUCN Red List as threatened or
            vulnerable.
